# PySearchEngine
 Wrote a basic search engine that uses a linear time compiled index to take advantage of hashmap's O(1) amoritized access times to preform constant time path lookups of any desired file on the user's physical volumes. Wrote both recursive and sequential versions. Also wrote optimized version with multiprocessing. Ran on Nvidia Xavier Jetson board to test microcontroller's multiprocessing capabilities.
